## Interview Questions

Explain in detail the workings of a dynamic array:
- An array with authomatic resizing implemented. Dynamic arrays resize as the element inside grows so size isn't necessarily hard-coded before initialization
- It still places items next to each other, making lookup fast and adding can be fast O(1) but O(n) when it needs to resize
- Inserts and deletes not happening at the end may result in O(n) time

* What is the runtime complexity to access an array, add or remove from the front, and add or remove from the back?
- access an array - O(1)
- add or remove from the front - O(n)
- add or remove from the back - O(1)

* What is the worse case scenario if you try to extend the storage size of a dynamic array?
- O(n)

Explain how a blockchain is structured. What are the blocks, what is the chain? How is the data organized?
- A chain of blocks, linked by carrying a hash of the previous block, containing transactions in order.
- The hash, SHA256, is used to identify specific blocks and the next block holds this information
- The block, which are comparible to linked list nodes , also contains the index and the proof and some other arbitrary information
 
Explain how proof of work functions. How does it operate. How does this protect the chain from attack. What kind of attack is possible?
- Proof of Work is used to acertain that the miner put in work and deverses to be rewarded. This is used to produced new blocks and add them to the chain, with transactions
- The miner keeps guessing to see if the proof is right and mines provided another person hasn't mined that block prior.
- In this way it protects the chain for attack as a miner would be competeing with numerous other miners to get the block mined.
- It also protects the chan by a block holding a reference to the hash of the previous block and a change in a block would alter the hash value in the next block and provide the chain void
- The miner would have to mine the longest chain by himself before any other miner mines a block.
- Distributed denial of service attacks
